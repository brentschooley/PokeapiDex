/**
  Information about a failed resource request.

  Siesta can encounter errors from many possible sources, including:

  - client-side encoding / request creation issues,
  - network connectivity problems,
  - protocol issues (e.g. certificate problems),
  - server errors (404, 500, etc.), and
  - client-side parsing and entity validation failures.

  `Error` presents all these errors in a uniform structure. Several properties preserve diagnostic information,
  which you can use to intercept specific known errors, but these diagnostic properties are all optional. They are not
  even mutually exclusive: Siesta errors do not break cleanly into HTTP-based vs. exception/NSError-based, for example,
  because network implementations may sometimes provide _both_ an underlying NSError _and_ an HTTP diagnostic.

  The one ironclad guarantee that `Error` makes is the presence of a `userMessage`.

      Underlying causes of errors reported by Siesta. You will find these on the `Error.cause` property.
      (Note that `cause` may also contain errors from the underlying network library that do not appear here.)

      The primary purpose of these error causes is to aid debugging. Client code rarely needs to work with them,
      but they can be useful if you want to add special handling for specific errors.

      For example, if you’re working with an API that sometimes returns garbled text data that isn’t decodable,
      and you want to show users a placeholder message instead of an error, then (1) gee, that’s weird, and
      (2) you can turn that one specific error into a success by adding a transformer:

          configure {
            $0.config.responseTransformers.add(GarbledResponseHandler())
          }

          ...

          struct GarbledResponseHandler: ResponseTransformer {
            func process(response: Response) -> Response {
              switch response {
                case .Success:
                  return response
